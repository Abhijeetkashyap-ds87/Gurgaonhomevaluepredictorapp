st.markdown("## Project Overview")
st.markdown("""
This application estimates residential property prices in Gurgaon using advanced machine learning techniques.  
It also recommends similar properties based on user preferences through a content-based recommendation system.

The goal of this project is to:
- Compare and evaluate different ML and DL models for property price prediction.
- Build a transparent and interpretable prediction pipeline.
- Provide a clean, interactive, and deployable solution using Streamlit.

# --- About Role ---
st.markdown("## My Role in the Project")
st.markdown("""
As a final-year B.Tech student at IIIT Agartala with an interest in machine learning and deployment,  
I developed this project to apply the concepts I‚Äôve learned and strengthen my practical understanding.

I was responsible for:
- Designing and training an XGBoost-based pipeline with custom feature engineering.
- Building a deep learning model (Custom ANN) and tuning it with Optuna.
- Using SHAP for interpreting machine learning model outputs.
- Creating an intuitive interface using Streamlit.
- Implementing a content-based recommender to suggest similar properties.
